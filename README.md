# Fruits

Fruits is a Discord bot used to manually track how many Devil Fruits you and your server have collected in two popular One Piece Roblox games. One being Grand Piece Online, and the other being Blox Fruits.

Fruits is a relatively simple bot to use. The bot gives you a maximum of two tables to store your Devil Fruit collection, one table for Grand Piece Online and the other for Blox Fruits. You can view your Grand Piece table by using !fruitsgpo or !fruits-gpo. If you wish to see your Blox Fruits tables use !fruitsblox or !fruits-blox. Adding a Devil Fruit is also very simple, just type the bot prefix followed by the fruit name. For example !suke, that will add a suke to your Grand Piece online Table. You can use the !help command to view all commands that the bot has to offer.
